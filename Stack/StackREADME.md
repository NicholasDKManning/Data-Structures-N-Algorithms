# Stacks (Python)

## What's a Stack?

A STACK is a type of data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO) rule.

You can think of it like a **stack of plates**:

- Adding a plate to the top → `PUSH`
- Removing a plate from the top → `POP`
- You can only access the **top plate** — not one in the middle or at the bottom

## Purpose of a Stack

Stacks are used when you need to:

- Reverse data
- Track **nested** structures (e.g., matching parentheses)
- Implement **undo** functionality
- Solve problems that require **backtracking**

In LeetCode’s **Valid Parentheses** problem, a stack helps ensure every opening bracket is properly closed in the correct order. The **last opened bracket must be closed first**, making the stack an ideal tool.
