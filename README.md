# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a curated collection of data structures, algorithms, and common coding patterns used in technical interviews and competitive programming. It's designed as a personal reference while solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.

### What's Included:
- ✅ Fundamental data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, hash maps, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- ✅ Core algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)
- ✅ LeetCode-style problem breakdowns with explanations
- ✅ Clean, well-commented code for quick reference
- ✅ Notes and pseudocode for deeper understanding

I built this as my own personal guide and reference while I prepare and stay ready for all technical interviews. All preparation is based off of previous technical interviews I've had, advice from other devs, or online resources.

> Whether you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow developer, feel free to browse the code and follow along as I continue to learn and grow.
