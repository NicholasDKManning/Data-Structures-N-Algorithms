# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a curated collection of data structures, algorithms, and common coding patterns used in technical interviews and competitive programming. It's designed as a personal reference while solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.

### What's Included:
- ✅ Fundamental data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, hash maps, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- ✅ Core algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)
- ✅ LeetCode-style problem breakdowns with explanations
- ✅ Clean, well-commented code for quick reference
- ✅ Notes and pseudocode for deeper understanding

### Why I Built This
As an aspiring software developer, this repo helps me:

- Prepare confidently for technical interviews
- Build a reference I can revisit and expand over time
